# SuChain
A dummy blockchain for learning purpose

## What I tried to do
- Make use of proff of work algorithm
- seperate various components. This design approach allowed this chain to be configurable to some extent
- A shell-like interface. Where one can interact to chain by giving command
- Some actual operation like airdropping and fund transfer

## How to use
*I suppose you already have rust installet and carge is available in path*
- Clone the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:sudipghimire533/suchain suchain && \
cd suchain
```

- Run a sample node interaction
```
sh tests/run.sh < tests/sample_run.su
```

**If you are here, I guess you have built some fun project also related or unrelated to suchain. If so I would very much like to see what have you done**

> **Also visit my blog at https://sudipg.com.np . I mostly write about rust, compiler optimization, substrate framework, blockhain and sometimes non-technicl stories & poems as well.**
